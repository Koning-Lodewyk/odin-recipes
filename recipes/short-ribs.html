    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>These braised short ribs are practically foolproof, with just two crucial steps ensuring a perfect dish. The first is to ensure the beef is well-browned—deep, dark, and caramelized to create a flavorful crust. This browning step is key to developing a rich, savory base for the braising liquid.</p>
    
    <p>The second step is simple: braise the short ribs until they are fork-tender. When they’re done, you should be able to stick a fork in them with ease, and they will be ready to melt in your mouth. As long as you follow these steps, you’ll end up with delicious, fall-off-the-bone short ribs every time. The only way to go wrong is to undercook them—so don’t skip the braising time!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 slices bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 quart beef broth</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer crisped bacon with a slotted spoon to a Dutch oven. Keep bacon drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat bacon drippings in the skillet over high heat. Cook short ribs in hot drippings until browned and caramelized on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to a Dutch oven, reserving drippings in the skillet. Add thyme and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the skillet until soft and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk flour into onion mixture and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour sherry into onion mixture; cook until thick and hot, about 2 minutes. Pour onion-sherry mixture into the Dutch oven; pour in beef broth and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover the Dutch oven with a lid.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the Dutch oven to the preheated oven and cook until short ribs are fork-tender, about 2 hours. Remove ribs to a serving dish, reserving sauce in the pot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Set Dutch oven over high heat and boil sauce until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Spoon reduced sauce over ribs.</li>

    </ol>
