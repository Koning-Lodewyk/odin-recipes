Recipe Website - Project Odin Foundations

Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course, where I will apply my knowledge of HTML to create a basic recipe website. The goal is to practice structuring a website with HTML and demonstrate my understanding of the key concepts I have learned so far.

The website will feature a main index page with links to a few recipe pages. Although it wonâ€™t be styled at this stage, the focus is on building a functional structure using semantic HTML elements. Styling and advanced design techniques will come later, but the goal now is to practice creating a clean, organized HTML layout.

Once I complete this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:

Structure a multi-page website using HTML.
Use appropriate HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
Create a basic navigation system between different pages.
Develop a functional webpage that displays information clearly and logically.
While this project might not look visually impressive yet, it serves as an important milestone in strengthening my foundational HTML skills, and I am looking forward to revisiting it later to add CSS styling.

Skills Demonstrated:
HTML structure and semantics.
Creating a navigation system with links.
Organizing content on a webpage.
